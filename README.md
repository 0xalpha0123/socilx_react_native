### SocialX a community-driven social media platform

Welcome to the SocialX source code repository!
SocialX is a community-driven social media platform allowing users to publish every form of creative content. We are opening a new chapter of how humans share snapshots of their lives and interact with each other.

### Releases

coming very soon.


### Core Features of the SocialX-App:
 
* Distributed social media network via a peer-to-peer network
*  Giving ownership of content back to social media users
*  Integrating freedom of speech as a core principle in our platform
*  Building a reward system where contributors are rewarded for sharing quality content.
*  Building a unique ad system which gives most of its revenue back to the community.
*  Enables you to take license management into your own hand

### SocialX Database System

Database peers save the data from SocialX and distribute it to the users. In the database peers we save e.g. user data, post data and comments.
